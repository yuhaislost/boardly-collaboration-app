# Boardly - A live collaboration platform
A web application aimed to simplify, organise and fast track communication between diverse and high-performing teams. Boardly is not just the quintessential SaaS rather it graduates into a partner, a friend and a paramount tool that is the hallmark of successful projects. Combining responsive databases and libraries with frictionless design, Boarldy is powered by the pioneering full-stack framework NextJs, both delivering secure authentication with ClerkJS and a myriad of practical functionalities. The communication tool enables users to create organisation groups, manage its members and contrive collaboration boards in LIVE TIME. Members are able to create, edit and view various elements on the board as well as see an indicator of collaborating friends.

This project was to learn, explore and develop skills regarding new full-stack technologies such as Next.js 14, TypeScript, LiveBlocks, Convex, Shadcn-UI and Clerk Authentication.
